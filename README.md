ECG anomaly detection:
In this app
1- I put into assessment the timeseries of normal(healthy) heart performance and unhealthy(anomal) heart performance. 
2- I used auto encoders to learn the behaviour of healthy heart signals.
3- I made the prediction and measured reconstruction loss for all the records.
4- I concluded the signals having a special degree of reconstruction loss are most probabely anomaly and vice versa.
